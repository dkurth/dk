TODO

- right now, the dk command only works when run from the dk folder!
- move the print_formatted code into a single place that can be shared by all commands
- set up dreamhostify
    dk new dreamhostify
    Figure out how to store secrets so they are not in the repo.
        Like, I want my private key available to the dreamhostify command, but it should not be stored in the git repo anywhere.
